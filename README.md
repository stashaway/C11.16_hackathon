# Find Food Fast

This application addresses a dilemma facing drivers everywhere- The need to find something to eat without getting distracted by the phone. This app gets your location upon load, then presents the user several food options. When the driver clicks a food option, FFF get their locations again and uses the two locations to determine a bearing or direction of travel. It then uses AJAX to query the Google Maps and Places APIs and find the nearby restaurants. However, instead of displaying the one closest like most other apps, it displays the closest one in the direction the user is travelling. It also automatically centers and zooms the map to show the user directions. In addition, it can display results in the opposite direction as well as play commericals from the restaurant chosen from YouTube.
